    <p>JOEL. [_With a singing call._] Four o'clock!--All's well!<br>

        [_Jumping down from the embankment, he approaches the fire._ <br>
   
   ANDREW. By God, Joel, it's bitter. <br>
   
   JOEL. [_Rubbing his hands over the coals._] A mite sharpish. <br>
   
   ANDREW. [_Looks up eagerly._] What? <br>
   
   JOEL. Cuts sharp, for Thanksgivin'. <br>
   
   ANDREW. [_Sinks back, gloomily._] Oh! [_A pause._] I wondered you should
   agree with me. You meant the weather. I meant--[_A pause again._ <br>
   
   JOEL. Well, Andy, what'd you mean? <br>
   
   ANDREW. Life. <br>
   
   JOEL. Shucks! <br>
   
   ANDREW. [_To himself._] Living! <br>
   
   JOEL. [_Sauntering over left, listens._] Hear a rooster crow? <br>
   
   ANDREW. No. What are you doing? <br>
   
   JOEL. Tiltin' the flag over crooked in the dirt. That's our signal. <br>
