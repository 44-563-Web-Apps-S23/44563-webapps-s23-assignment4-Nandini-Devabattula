    <p>JOEL. [_With a singing call._] Four o'clock!--All's well!

        [_Jumping down from the embankment, he approaches the fire._
   
   ANDREW. By God, Joel, it's bitter.
   
   JOEL. [_Rubbing his hands over the coals._] A mite sharpish.
   
   ANDREW. [_Looks up eagerly._] What?
   
   JOEL. Cuts sharp, for Thanksgivin'.
   
   ANDREW. [_Sinks back, gloomily._] Oh! [_A pause._] I wondered you should
   agree with me. You meant the weather. I meant--[_A pause again._
   
   JOEL. Well, Andy, what'd you mean?
   
   ANDREW. Life.
   
   JOEL. Shucks!
   
   ANDREW. [_To himself._] Living!
   
   JOEL. [_Sauntering over left, listens._] Hear a rooster crow?
   
   ANDREW. No. What are you doing?
   
   JOEL. Tiltin' the flag over crooked in the dirt. That's our signal.
